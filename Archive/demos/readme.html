<h1>Demos</h1>
<p>Here are a number of demo scripts that show interesting behaviour or
demonstrate some purpose. Often they show the difference in performance
or time for different methods of doing the same thing.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>shell_true_false.py</code></li>
<li><code>min_max.lua</code></li>
<li><code>get_year.lua</code></li>
<li><code>hash.lua</code></li>
<li><code>string_print.lua</code></li>
<li><code>date2secs.lua</code></li>
<li><code>str-concat.lua</code></li>
<li><code>builtin_extern.sh</code></li>
</ul>
<h2><code>shell_true_false.py</code></h2>
<p>Python can start an external command using the <code>subprocess.Popen(...)</code>
command. This takes an optional argument <code>shell</code> which is either <code>True</code>
or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>When true, the shell is used to run the command, ie <code>sh -c cmd</code>, when
false, the command is run directly but the command must be passed as
a list with the command name itself as the first element and arguments
after.</p>
<p>This script shows the effect of shell being true vs false.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<pre><code>Shell is True
99
Average time: 0.00100619530678
Shell is False
99
Average time: 0.00113763618469
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Cygwin</strong></p>
<pre><code>Shell is True
99
Average time: 0.0242535800934
Shell is False
99
Average time: 0.0195034759045
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, <code>shell=True</code> takes a shorter time under Linux, but a
longer time under cygwin.</p>
<h2><code>builtin_extern.sh</code></h2>
<p>This script compares the effect of using bash builtin string manipulation
vs using calls to external programs. This is primarily aimed at showing
the effect of calling many external programs when running under cygwin
since the overhead of <code>fork()</code>ing there is much higher.</p>
<p>The script counts the number of newlines in a string, first by replacing
everything not a newline with nothing then counting the number of
characters and second by piping the string to <code>wc -l</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<pre><code>1000 : 6
real    0m0.125s
user    0m0.040s
sys     0m0.008s
1000 : 6
real    0m1.853s
user    0m0.048s
sys     0m0.064s
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Cygwin</strong></p>
<pre><code>1000 : 6
real    0m0.076s
user    0m0.062s
sys     0m0.000s
1000 : 6
real    0m43.631s
user    0m6.101s
sys     0m16.383s
</code></pre>
<p>The difference between builtin vs external calls is much smaller under
Linux, but is still noticable.</p>
<h2><code>str-concat.lua</code></h2>
<p>There are different ways of generating a string which is composed of
several pieces. This script shows the relative time to make a string
out of several components by:</p>
<ol>
<li>explicitly concatenating them together with the lua <code>..</code>
concatenation operator</li>
<li>use <code>table.concat</code> to join the table of components</li>
<li>use <code>sting.format</code> with a format string set.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>n = 1000000
String concat: 0.234
Table concat: 0.468
String format: 1.31
</code></pre>
<p>The time to join the strings will depend on the strings themselves and
the number, but for this example, explicit is considerably faster.</p>
<h2><code>date2secs.lua</code></h2>
<p>Converting a string containing a date/time to seconds since the unix
epoch is really just a case of getting the right numbers for the right
positions in the string. Here, we test the speed of matching those
numbers vs just using the positions directly.</p>
<pre><code>n = 1000000
Match: 0.624
Match2: 0.561
Sub: 0.546
</code></pre>
<p>Matching is marginally slower, but in many cases would provide the better
readability of the code so would be chosen. Selecting parts of the string
by index can quickly lead to unmaintainability.</p>
<h2><code>string_print.lua</code></h2>
<p>Printing a large amount of text has a performance impact. We have
the choice to either print the text as it is available, or to save it
together and print it all at once. Here, we test both, for a short and
for longer strings.</p>
<pre><code>str lenght = 1
Immediate write: 0.998
Table collect then write: 0.328

str lenght = 1001
Immediate write: 0.967
Table collect then write: 2.06
</code></pre>
<p>For the case where the individual strings are short, it is faster to
store them up and print alogether. For longer strings, however, the
performace impact of creating the table with many large strings and then
concatenating them together becomes important.</p>
<h2><code>hash.lua</code></h2>
<p>Implementation of some simple string hashing algorithms with demonstration
of the collision rate for a dictionary of strings.</p>
<h2><code>get_year.lua</code></h2>
<p>Comparison of three different methods of obtaining the current year
as an integer, returning a table of values and extracting the relavent
member, generating the year as a string and converting to a number or
manual calculation based on the number of seconds in a year. Each could
be modified to return other values.</p>
<pre><code>1487695221      2017, 2017, 2017
date table:     1.232 seconds
date tonumber:  0.718 seconds
manual calc:    0.015 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Cleary, the manual calcuation is easily the fastest. The date table has
to create a whole table of values just for the single interesting one,
so is inefficient. Using <code>tonumber()</code> is faster as only the relavent
value is created, but it does involve strings which slow it down. The
manual method is crude and approximate but very fast by comparison.</p>
<h2><code>min_max.lua</code></h2>
<p>Recording the current highest or lowest seen value is common when
iterating through an unsorted list. The different methods of checking
the new value against the current high/low value are tested here.</p>
<pre><code>Func global     1.154   10      10000000
Func local      0.78    10      10000000
Ternary         0.203   10      10000000
Comparison      0.203   10      10000000
</code></pre>
<p>Making a global call the <code>math.min</code> or <code>math.max</code> is by far the slowest
due to the global variable lookup and the cost of the function call. The
added complexity of the approximated lua ternary expression
(<code>x = A and x or y</code>) does not add enough benefit. By far the fastest is
the simple <code>if</code> check.</p>
